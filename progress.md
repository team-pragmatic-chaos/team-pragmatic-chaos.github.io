title: Progress Summary

We have been successful in implementing 3 variations of LSTM based models from end to end. We have also been making incremental updates towards improving our model architecture and optimizing our loss functions in order to improve our results with the help of our teaching assistants Shao Hua Sun and Artem Molchanov.
